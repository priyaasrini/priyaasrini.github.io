## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="20181111.webp">

Hi! I am currently an International Associate at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA. I finished my Ph.D. at the University of Calgary under the supervision of <a href= "https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/"> Dr. Robin Cockett </a>. 

I am interested in Category Theory and its applications to quantum computing. I would describe myself as a Computer Scientist and a Category Theorist. 

Keywords: Linearly distributive categories, categorical quantum mechanics
